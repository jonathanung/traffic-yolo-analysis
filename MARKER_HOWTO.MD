## Note to Markers

Taking your own time to download, preprocess, train, and test the models on the pre-existing sets of data is extremely unecessary. The necessary data for the analysis is already present in data.

All of the analysis graphs and csvs can be fetched by running:
```bash
bash analysis.sh
```
